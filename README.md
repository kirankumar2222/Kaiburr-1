# Java Rest API CRUD Operations using SpringBoot
This repository provides a sample Java REST API application built using Spring Boot that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a simple resource. This README file will guide you through setting up, running, and using the application.

# Prerequisities
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Java: Make sure you have Java 8 or higher installed.
* Maven: This project uses Maven as the build tool. Make sure you have it installed
* Mysql workbench: Choose either of the database like mongoDb etc, my system as compactible to mysql workbench
* Server: Spring framework has inbuild tomcat server use any server you want
  
# Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

# Build and Run
This will build the project and start the Spring Boot application. The API will be available at http://localhost:8080/api.

# Application OverView
The Java Spring Boot CRUD API is a simple application that allows you to perform CRUD operations on a resource. In this example, we're managing a collection of items. You can add, retrieve, update, and delete items through the exposed API endpoints.

# API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available:

* GET /api/items: Retrieve a list of all items.
* GET /api/items/{id}: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
* POST /api/items: Create a new item.
* Request body should contain JSON data with item details.
* PUT /api/items/{id}: Update an existing item by ID.
* Request body should contain JSON data with item details.
* DELETE /api/items/{id}: Delete an item by ID.
For detailed usage and request/response examples, refer to the API documentation at /docs when the application is running.

# Operations Done
* Create
* Update
* Delete
* Post
* Exception handling

# Deployment 
* Finally run the project by upping your server and your good to go!!!
